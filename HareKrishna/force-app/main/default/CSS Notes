A css rule consists of a selector and a declaration
the selector points to the html elements
 the declaration block contains one or more declarations with a property and value.
 example= {color:blue; font-size:16px}
the selector can be an element, class, or id.
the declaration block is enclosed in curly braces {}.
the way we apply css in a html document is by using the style tag inside the  head tag.
the style tag contains the css rules is called Inline CSS.
Inline Styling is used to apply styles directly to an HTML element using the style attribute without using a seperate css file.these rules will only apply to the specific paragraph element in which the style attribute has been added.
Internal Styling is used to apply styles to an entire HTML document using the style tag inside the head tag. these rules will apply to all the elements in the document.
External Styling is used to apply styles to multiple HTML documents using a separate CSS file linked to the document.
for Ids we cannot put directly in the css file, we have to use the # symbol before the id name.
for classes we have to use the . symbol before the class name.
