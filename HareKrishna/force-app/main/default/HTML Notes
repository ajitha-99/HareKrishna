HTML - Hypertext markup language
all documents must start with <!DOCTYPE declaration.
Starting tag should be the <html> tag and ending tag should be </html>.
The <head> tag contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and links to stylesheets.
The <body> tag contains the content of the document, such as text, images, and links.
The <title> tag sets the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
The <h1> to <h6> tags are used for headings, with <h1> being the highest level and <h6> being the lowest.
The <p> tag is used for paragraphs of text.
    the element is a collection of start tag and end tag with content in between.
    Attributes provide additional information about an element, such as class, id, style, etc.
   Attributes are specified in the opening tag of an element, and they consist of a name and a value.
    Example: <p class="text">This is a paragraph.</p>
    Attributes usually come in name-value pairs, separated by an equals sign.
    Multiple attributes can be added to an element by separating them with spaces.
    when we image tag we have to use src attribute to specify the image source.

    alt defines what  the image is about and display messages when image is not loaded. 
    block elements take up the full width available and start on a new line from left to right, such as <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>.
    inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line, such as <span>, <a>, <img>.
    The <div> tag is a block-level element used to group content together, while the <span> tag is an inline element used to style a portion of text within a block-level element.
        the block elements can contain block level as well as inline elements, but inline elements can only contain text or other inline elements.
    The <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks, and it requires the href attribute to specify the URL of the link.
        Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a>
        div is used to divide the page into mltiple sections, while span is used to style a portion of text within a block-level element.
    The <img> tag is used to display images, and it requires the src attribute to specify the image source.
        Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">

Data attribute is used to store custom data private to the page or application.
the data attribute gives us the ability to add custom attributes on all HTML elements.
    Example: <div data-custom-attribute="value">Content</div>
    we can access the data attribute using JavaScript by using the dataset property.
    Example: document.querySelector('div').dataset.customAttribute
    The data attribute is useful for storing additional information that is not part of the standard HTML attributes.
    It allows us to add custom data to elements without affecting the HTML structure or functionality.
    the attribute name should not contain any uppercase letters, spaces, or special characters.
    It should start with "data-" followed by a lowercase letter and can be followed by lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens.
    The value of the data attribute can be any string, including numbers, text, or JSON data.
    The data attribute can be used to store information that can be accessed later using JavaScript or
